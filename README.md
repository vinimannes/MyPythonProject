Car prices around USA (Python / Tableau)

This is a project where you extract all car sales information from one of the largest car sales platforms in the country.
Every result is demonstrated through Tableau, and price variables can be analyzed by applying different filters if necessary.

In this project you can find languages as Python, ETL, WebScrapping, Excel and SQL.

Thanks for looking! =)
